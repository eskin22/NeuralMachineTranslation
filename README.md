# ðŸ¤” What is this project?

A Spanish-to-English neural machine translator using Recursive Neural Network (RNN) and Transformer-based deep learning approaches. 

This project was done in accordance with the course [CS 447 Natural Language Processing](https://cs.illinois.edu/academics/courses/cs447) in the Master's of Computer Science program at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. 

# ðŸš€ Usage

## Dependencies

> [!NOTE]  
> **Python 3.10** is required in order to run `setup.py`. If you do not have **Python 3.10** installed, please download it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-31013/) before proceeding.

## Setup

This project can be used to translate text in several ways. Machine translation is implemented using two deep learning approaches: using and RNN and using a Transformer. You can either use the pre-trained models in `models`, or you can run the notebook `train_translation_models.ipynb` to train your own!

### Option 1: Using pre-trained models

### Option 2: Training your own models
